# Speech Emotion Recognition Using LSTM

## Project Overview


This repository contains code and resources for a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project using the TESS dataset and LSTM model. SER involves classifying emotions from audio data, crucial for applications like human-computer interaction.




## Dataset

The TESS dataset consists of high-quality audio recordings from two female actresses across seven emotions. It includes 2800 WAV format audio files organized by actress and emotion.
## Key Features

- Implemented LSTM model for emotion classification.
- Strategies like L2 regularization, learning rate adjustment, early stopping, model checkpointing, and data augmentation were applied to improve accuracy.
- Achieved an accuracy of 88.7% on the validation set.
